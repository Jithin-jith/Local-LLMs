# Local-LLMs
This repository contains implementations of how LLMs can be run locally using Ollama and LM Studio.

## What are Open LLM Models
Open LLM models are Large Language Models that are made publicly available, either fully open-source or with permissive licenses, allowing developers and organizations to:

- Use them for free (often commercially too)
- Fine-tune or adapt them for specific tasks
- Deploy them on their own hardware or in the cloud

## ðŸ§ª Use Cases of Open LLMs
- Fine-tuning for custom chatbots or agents
- Embedding in private/local applications
- Educational use and research
- Evaluating fairness, bias, safety, etc.
- Building domain-specific assistants
