# Local-LLMs
This repository contains implementations of how LLMs can be run locally using Ollama and LM Studio.

## What are Open LLM Models
Open LLM models are Large Language Models that are made publicly available, either fully open-source or with permissive licenses, allowing developers and organizations to:

- Use them for free (often commercially too)
- Fine-tune or adapt them for specific tasks
- Deploy them on their own hardware or in the cloud

## 🧪 Use Cases of Open LLMs
- Fine-tuning for custom chatbots or agents
- Embedding in private/local applications
- Educational use and research
- Evaluating fairness, bias, safety, etc.
- Building domain-specific assistants

## 🔍 What Makes an LLM “Open”?
An LLM is generally considered open if it meets most of these criteria:

|Criteria                |	Description                                                             |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|✅ Weights Available    |	The trained model weights are freely downloadable                         |
|✅ Open License |	License allows commercial use, fine-tuning, and redistribution |
|✅ Code Access |	Training code, inference code, or config is shared|
|❌ Not Hosted Online |	Doesn’t require you to use the provider’s API (unlike GPT-4, Claude, etc.) |
