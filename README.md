# Local-LLMs
This repository contains implementations of how LLMs can be run locally using Ollama and LM Studio.

## what are Open LLM Models
Open LLM models are Large Language Models that are made publicly available, either fully open-source or with permissive licenses, allowing developers and organizations to:

- Use them for free (often commercially too)
- Fine-tune or adapt them for specific tasks
- Deploy them on their own hardware or in the cloud
